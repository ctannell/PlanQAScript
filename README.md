# PlanQAScript
ESAPI Plan QA in Eclipse v15

This project is a tool to aid in a physics second check of Eclipse plans. Written for Eclipse version 15. It can function as both a standalone and a script. When functioning as a script, place the "ScriptRelay.cs" file in your main script directory and edit the path to the .exe. The script relay will pass the context into the exe so the data won't need to be retrieved from the DB a second time.
