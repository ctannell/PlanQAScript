v2.0
- A rewrite of the entire code. It follows the method by Rex at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVAQf_bsaZg&t where the same code base can be run as a standalone (for easy debugging) or a script (for deployment). Note that an extra script file exists outside the solution that is the file launched by Eclipse in script mode. The script sends the context to the compiled exe into the XScript class. XScript uses the MarshalbyRefObject inherited class that allows remote communication between applications.

- Rewrote the GUI to use WPF
- GUI now has a details button that shows a window listing all the tests performed by the script
